    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Generate new OpenAPI types:

    ```bash

## Project Structure

The project is structured around the concept of "Periods" and "Draws".

- **Periods**: These are the available time slots for the cabin that users can sign up for. They have a start and end
  date and belong to a draw. Most of the time, the period will be from Monday to Sunday, but it can be any period of
  time. For example, the first winter break period starts on the Friday before the winter break week.

- **Draws**: These are deadlines for signing up to a period. I'm considering refactoring to make this clearer.
